This Repository is for the training of manually building DSA  including Queues, Stacks,  Singular LL, Doubly LL, and Circular LL. Plus, building the Sorting algorithms (Insertion, bubble, and selection), Merge, and Quick sort Algorithms as well.

Additionally, it includes Linear Search and Binary Search.

For Binary Trees it includes building a Binary Tee with Its traversal (pre-in-post) order and Insertion and deletion of Nodes using Successor and Processor Techniques)
